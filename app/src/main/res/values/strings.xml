    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Danilo.
    \n\nI love to learn new technologies
    \n\nSometimes I just start learning things that I don\'t know if I gonna use, but is fun to
        understand how things work, even if you not gonna use it.
    \n\nThis might be a problem because learn takes times, and sometimes I fell like I should be
        using this time to learn something useful to my stack, but this is something that I should
        improve in my career.
